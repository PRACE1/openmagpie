"""SingleFlightCommand: a management command that won't run twice at once.

Scheduled jobs (poll / trigger / drain) are launched on a cadence, and a
pass can outlast its interval (a deep drain backlog judges items
synchronously). Subclassing this makes a second launch of the SAME command
log and skip while one is in flight, instead of piling up behind it. The
lock key defaults to the command's own file name (its invocation name), so
each command single-flights against itself, never against the others.

Built on `job_lock` (cache/DB-backed via `named_lock`), so it serializes
across processes AND machines, and releases via the lock's owner-token
finally on every graceful exit. Opt-in: a command that WANTS to run N-wide
(the drain is safe to, via its CAS claim) just stays on plain BaseCommand.
